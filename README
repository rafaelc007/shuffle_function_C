This repository contains C code implementing a function that shuffles an array of integers randomly.

The shuffle function is called: void print_array(int * array, size_t size);
    where: array is an array of integers to be shuffled
    	   size is the size of the array

*OBS: the function implemented works in O(n) time complexity.
